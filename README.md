- Microsoft OAuth using Passport.js
- New social users directed to complete their profile

## Authentication Flow

1. **Traditional Login**:
   - User enters username and password
   - Server validates credentials and creates session
   - User is redirected to dashboard

2. **Social Login**:
   - User clicks on social login button (Google or Microsoft)
   - User is redirected to OAuth provider login
   - After successful OAuth, server checks if user exists:
     - If new user: redirected to complete profile page
     - If existing user: redirected to dashboard

3. **Profile Completion** (for new social login users):
   - User enters preferred username
   - User can update display name
   - User is redirected to dashboard after completion

## Account Linking

If a user logs in with social auth using an email that already exists in the system:
- The accounts are linked automatically
- User can login with either method

## Setup Instructions

See [setup-instructions.md](setup-instructions.md) for details on how to configure the application, especially OAuth credentials.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables (see setup instructions)

3. Run the development server:
